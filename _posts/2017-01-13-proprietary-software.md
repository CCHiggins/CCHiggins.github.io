Have you ever taken an inventory of all the software or digital services that you use in your day-to-day life?

Perhaps you *need* Microsoft Office for work. Or perhaps you *depend* on Facebook to stay in contact with friends and relatives. Maybe you *must* use a MacOS for all your other services to run correctly. What would happen if this software stops doing what you need it to do, or worse, what would happen if it disappears entirely?

While questions like these have haunted IT managers for years, the average consumer doesn't give it a thought until it's already too late. In a world in which more and more of our everyday tasks are dependent on technology, we must all ask ourselves if we have given software developers too much power over our lives.

All of the software listed above falls into a category called proprietary software. In the proprietary software business model, the publisher retains intellectual rights to the source code.

Due to copyright law, the publisher can place restrictions on the use of the software, inspection and editing of source code of the software, and redistribution of the software. In the early days of computing, this measure was seen as necessary to protect the economic incentives of developers and publishers.

In this [1976 letter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Bill_Gates_Letter_to_Hobbyists.jpg), Bill Gates states that royalties from developing a Microsoft Windows predecessor have valued their work at $2 per hour despite having a wide user base, most of which were using the software in violation of copyright law. Gates says that lack of copyright enforcement would hinder future software development, proclaiming, "Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?"

While this application of copyright law protected developers and allowed the industry to flourish, consumers have borne the consequences.

Proprietary software often comes with a phenomenon called *lock-in*. A lock-in happens when switching software is designed to be impossible or comes at such a high cost that users are discouraged from switching. Here's an example: In 2012, [Wired reported that Microsoft Office's 90 percent market share isn't due to "loyal fanboys" or "retail demand,"](https://www.wired.com/2012/07/why-youre-still-using-office/) but that it owes its market share to decades of popularity:

> "The Office juggernaut keeps rolling thanks to inertia. The companies that drive the global economy use Office. And whatever pain they suffer as a result—the price, the security holes, whining workers—is still a picnic compared to the massive headache of switching to something new.

This creates a situation in which software publishers aren't necessarily beholden to their consumers' needs. Companies are free to make *user hostile* changes and face few consequences.

These changes may vary from a small inconvenience to a complete overhaul of key functionality. Lock-in to a user hostile environment has become so commonplace that you may not have realized that you're a victim.

Take Facebook. When a Facebook timeline overhaul pops up every few years, we may post complaints (on our Facebook pages) but the vast majority of users will still continue to return because so much of their lives are already sequestered there. And while Facebook's timeline layout is fairly low stakes, changes like these are only the tip of the iceberg.

If you were a Windows 7 or 8 user, the push to upgrade to Windows 10 probably gave you all kinds of annoyances. Forbes reported on the "[dirty tricks](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/12/16/microsoft-windows-10-free-upgrades-worse/#7ee4873a7797)" that Windows used to con people into upgrading. Some of these user hostile tricks involved offering no clear decline option, violating Microsofts' own developer guidelines about the functionality of the Red X, and automatically downloading and installing Windows 10 for users that have not actively disabled or lacked the knowledge to disable automatic updates in their system settings. This software rollout was designed to remove as much choice as possible from the user.

If you're an Apple fanboy, you aren't immune either. Apple has created a special form of lock-in: Since Apple has created its software to be proprietary to its hardware, dependance on the software also produces lock-in to their hardware. Apple's new line of phones [have been criticized for dropping a standard audio connectivity port](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/21/11991302/iphone-no-headphone-jack-user-hostile-stupid) and their new computers abandoned the ubiquitous USB-A connection, rendering most computer accessories useless.

Going forward, users dependent on the Apple software system that are seeking to upgrade their hardware will need to adapt to an adapter-ridden environment or struggle to transition away from the platform.

Despite these problems, [Microsoft's stock has climbed](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/msft/stock-chart?intraday=off&timeframe=2y&splits=off&earnings=off&movingaverage=None&lowerstudy=volume&comparison=off&index=&drilldown=off) since Windows 10's release and Apple just posted [record quarterly earnings](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/01/apple-reports-record-first-quarter-results.html) after their latest phone and computer lines. Both companies were able to make unpopular design choices and face no economic consequences because they've coaxed consumers into exclusive reliance.

To make matters worse, the pace at which this phenomenon happens is expanding.

As we become reliant on technology for more day-to-day tasks, the grasp of proprietary lock-in becomes tighter. What happens when your lightbulbs, locks, refrigerator, and other various household objects come with embedded software that is dependent on other software and devices? Imagine a world in which stocking every item in your house becomes a question of compatibility with your other systems. By integrating more of our lives with technology, we are slowly yielding what remains of our autonomy to the whims of Silicon Valley.

Perhaps the user hostile changes haven't been drastically far-reaching but there is still the potential for tech companies to expand their control to almost every aspect of peoples' lives. Their power isn't kept in check by market demand, and is protected by copyright law and our reliance on technology.

At what point do we give up all our autonomy? I fear a future where *Tech Tyrants* are able to completely bend all to their will.
