Recently I signed up for a service from the United States Postal Service that promised to email an image of all the mail that would appear in my mailbox later that day. The service delivered on its promise and kept me sane as I waited for correspondence from law schools. I was amazed that technology was able to optically identify my mail and warn me it was coming. While the technology seems to recognize envelopes meant for me fairly well, I have also received images of mail meant for other people.

Earlier this week I opened my informed delivery digest email to find out that I had an incoming letter from a non-profit organization that offered support for people with eating disorders. I was shocked that group of this nature would be pursuing what I could only assume was a poorly targeted direct mail marketing campaign. As I examined the incoming envelope more I realized that the letter was addressed to someone in a completely different city who happened to have a very similar street address to me. The mail never showed up in my mailbox but I began to be haunted by the experience. By pure postal accident, I found out that I have a street address doppelg√§nger who was perhaps struggling with an eating disorder. I began to wonder if any images of my mail had found their way into a stranger's inbox and what they were able to find out about me just from looking at the outside of the envelope.

Defenders of mass surveillance often like to point out that no one is reading the content of your emails or listening in on your phone calls. Instead they're just collecting the metadata. That is they're not collecting the content of you communications, just the information about who you're communicating with. I think situations like this challenge this. I did not need to open the envelope and read the contents to breach their private life, I merely had to examine the *metadata* printed on the outside of the envelope. How much could a stranger learn about you just by looking at envelopes showing up in your mail box? How much would they learn by examining the "to" and "from" parts of your emails? What will they learn from who's number you're dialing? Will they know too much?
